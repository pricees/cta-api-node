# cta-api-node
Thin node wrapper for the Chicago Transit Authority API written in Node.js

### Notes ###

I am new to node. My concentration was making this an extremely thin wrapper using only node core modules. As such, you will find no non-core dependencies. I also felt that testing would be over kill.

__Responses are in XML. Take this up with Rahm.__

Lots of juicy info for Chicago's developers here:

### Usage ###

Get the api keys from Chicago Trainsit above

```bash
$ export CTA_TRAIN_API_KEY=hunter2
$ export CTA_BUS_API_KEY=azureDiamond
$ node my_awesome.js
```

```javascript
// my_awesome.js

var ctaNode = require("cta-api");

var trainApiKey = process.env.CTA_TRAIN_API_KEY
    , busApiKey = process.env.CTA_BUS_API_KEY;

ctaNode
  .train
  .arrivals
  .get({ mapid: 40360, max: 1, key: trainApiKey }, 
      function(data) { console.log("Data: " + data); },
      function(e) { console.log("Error: " + e.message); });
```
